Q1) Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2

HTTP:
 HTTP=>stands for HYPER TEXT TRANSFER PROTOCOL& ans it is used in CLINT-SERVER communication. several stages  of development of HTTP are there. but, mainly focus on HTTP/1.1 & HTTP/2.

HTTP/1.1:
 1.it was created in 1997.
 2.Ithe usest workson the TEXTUAL FARMAT.
 3.there is head of line blocking that blocks all its requests behind it until it doesnot get its all resources.
 4.it was requests resources Inlining for use getting multiple pages.
 5.it compresses data by itself.
 6.loades resourcesone after the other, so if one resource cannot be loaded, it blocks all the other resources behind it.

HTTP/2:
 1.it was created in 2015
 2.it works on the BINARY PROTOCAL
 3.it allows multiplexing so one tcp connection is required for multiple requestes.
 4.it uses PUSH frame by server that collects all multiple pages.
 5.it uses HPACK for data compression.
 6.http2 is able to use a single TCP connection to send multiple streams of data at once so that no one resource blocks any other resource.

Q2) Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript

OBJECTS AND ITS INTERNAL REPRESENTATION IN JS:
 
 OBJECTS=>1.in javascript is its most important DATA TYPE.
 2.and forms the building blocks for modern javascript.
 3.objects are more complex and each object may contain any combination of the PRIMITIVE DATA TYPE as well as reference DATA TYPE.
 4. NON PREMITIVE DATATYPE=>array,object=>call by reference.
 5.we can use SPREAD operator to avoid call by reference.
 6.object=>
    1.an object
    2.an array
    3.JSON
    4.CLASS
    5.OOPS
 7. keys&values
 8.key will be unique.
 9.latest key value pair will be considered if the key is COMMAN.
 10.we can take value with the help of KEY.
 11.key should be =>1.string 2.number 3.boolean 4.null 5.undefined=>this is called primitive data type=>we cannot iterate.
 12.to FETCH all the key at once =>OBJECT.KEYS(OBJ);
 13.to FETCH all the value at once OBJECT.VALUES(OBJ)
 14.it will be only inside the {}.
 15.in objact we use multipul keys:values,so we should use "," between the keys:values
 OBJECT FORMAT:
  var obj={"key":"value","key1":"value1","key2":"value2","key3":"value3"}

how to fetch one value in the obj=> obj[key1]=>output=>"value1"

1)Difference between HTTP1.1 vs. HTTP2?
HTTP stands for hypertext transfer protocol, and it is the basis for almost all web applications. More specifically, HTTP is the method computers and servers use to request and send information.

The first usable version of HTTP was created in 1997. Because it went through several stages of development, this first version of HTTP was called HTTP/1.1. This version is still in use on the web. In 2015, a new version of HTTP called HTTP/2 was created.

HTTP/2 solves several problems that the creators of HTTP/1.1 did not anticipate. In particular, HTTP/2 is much faster and more efficient than HTTP/1.1.

Difference of HTTP/1.1 vs. HTTP2:

HTTP/1.1
It works on the textual format.
There is head of line blocking that blocks all the requests behind it until it doesn’t get its all resources.
It uses requests resource Inlining for use getting multiple pages
It compresses data by itself.

HTTP/2
It works on the binary protocol.
It allows multiplexing so one TCP connection is required for multiple requests.
It uses PUSH frame by server that collects all multiple pages 
It uses HPACK for data compression.


2) Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in JavaScript?

Object:
In JavaScript, an object is a standalone entity, with properties and type. Compare it with a cup, for example. A cup is an object, with properties. A cup has a color, a design, weight, a material it is made of, etc. The same way, JavaScript objects can have properties, which define their characteristics.

Creating Objects in JavaScript:

1.	By object literal
2.	By creating instance of Object directly (using new keyword)

By object literal:

The syntax of creating object using object literal is given below:
 
   object = {
   property 1 : value 1,
   property 2 : value 2,
   .....
   property n : value n
   };

   Property and value is separated by colon(:)

Example:
         var Person = 
         {
         Fname : "xxxx",
         Lname : "yyy",
         Age   :  25
         };

 By creating instance of Object directly (using new keyword):

The syntax of creating object directly is given below:
 
     var objectname = new Object();

    A new keyword is used to create object.

Example:
           var emp = new Object();
           emp.id = 101;
           emp.name = "xxxx";
           emp.salary = 500000;
 

Accessing JavaScript Objects:

The syntax for accessing the property of an object is:

 objectName.property (or) objectName[“property”]

Accessing ‘fname’ from example 1 using dot operator,
       
       Person.Fname
 
Accessing ‘name’ form example 2 using [],

        emp["name"]
